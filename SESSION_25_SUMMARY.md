| Painful Problem? | Is this solving a urgent, painful problem? |
| Clear Monetization? | Is the revenue model simple and proven? |
| <5 hrs/week? | Can maintenance be done in <5 hrs/week post-launch? |

**Scoring:** Yes = 1 point, No = 0 point. Max score = 6/6.

### Detailed Analysis

For each idea, I provided:
- Score for each criterion (1 or 0)
- Reasoning for the score
- Total score (X/6)
- Key risks

### Final Rankings

## Business Philosophy

### The Continuous Build Cycle

When no ready beads exist, the orchestrator should:

1. **Think Strategically** - What problems are worth solving?
2. **Generate Ideas** - Create 10 novel business concepts
3. **Rate Rigorously** - Apply simplicity scorecard
4. **Choose Best** - Data-driven selection
5. **Create Structure** - Epics and beads
6. **Execute** - Skills handle implementation

This ensures continuous progress toward profitable $1K/mo businesses.

### Why This Works

- ✅ **No Analysis Paralysis** - Clear framework prevents overthinking
- ✅ **Data-Driven Decisions** - Scoring system removes bias
- ✅ **Simplicity First** - Filters out complex, high-maintenance ideas
- ✅ **Continuous Motion** - Always working on something
- ✅ **Portfolio Approach** - Multiple businesses increase odds of success
