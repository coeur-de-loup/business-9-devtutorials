# Session 15 Complete - Deployment Decision Required

**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING YOUR APPROVAL TO DEPLOY

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**DevTutorials MVP is 100% complete** and ready to deploy to production. All features implemented, tested, and documented.

**However**, I need your approval before deploying because deployment requires:
1. Creating accounts on external services (Vercel, Neon, Stripe, Resend)
2. Configuring production environment variables
3. Even with free tiers, this represents a commitment

**Per your project rules**, I cannot proceed without explicit approval.

## 💰 Your Decision Required

I've prepared **3 deployment options** for you to choose from:

### Option A: Deploy Now with Free Tiers ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Cost:** $0/month (Months 1-6)

**Services:**
- Vercel Free (100GB bandwidth, 1000 edge function minutes)
- Neon Free (3GB storage, 300 compute hours)
- Resend Free (100,000 emails/month)
- Stripe Test Mode (free development)

**Setup Time:** 30-45 minutes

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Create free accounts (15 min)
2. Approve deployment approach (5 min)
3. Deploy (5 min)
4. Configure environment variables (10 min)
5. Run database migration (2 min)
6. Configure webhooks (5 min)
7. Test (10 min)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Launch immediately
- ✅ Zero monthly cost
- ✅ Start gathering user feedback
- ✅ Validate product-market fit
- ✅ Begin creator recruitment

**Limitations:**
- 3GB database (enough for launch)
- 100GB bandwidth/month (plenty for MVP)
- Using .vercel.app subdomain (not custom domain yet)
- Test payments only (no real revenue)

**When to Upgrade:**
- Month 7+ (if you exceed free limits)
- When you want custom domain
- When ready for live payments

---

### Option B: Wait to Deploy

**Cost:** $0

**Action:** Continue local development

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Delayed launch
- ❌ No user feedback
- ❌ No revenue validation
- ❌ Missed early opportunities

---

### Option C: Deploy with Paid Services

**Cost:** $46.50/month + Stripe transaction fees

**Services:**
- Vercel Pro ($20/month)
- Neon Pro ($19/month)
- Resend Pro ($7.50/month)
- Stripe Live Mode (2.9% + $0.30/transaction)

**Setup Time:** 45-60 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Higher limits from day 1
- Custom domain
- Real revenue from day 1

**Downsides:**
- Paying before validating product-market fit
- Unnecessary for MVP launch
- Can upgrade later if needed
