## Technical Decisions

### Why These 4 Epics

Following the proven framework from DevTutorials:
1. **Discovery** - Validate before building
2. **Strategy** - Plan before coding
3. **Build** - Implement with TDD
4. **Launch** - Market and deploy

### Why This Dependency Chain

- **Sequential discovery:** All 4 discovery tasks can run in parallel
- **Strategy after discovery:** Need validation before planning
- **Architecture after strategy:** Need business model before designing system
- **Cascading build:** Infrastructure → parsing → engine → UI → testing
- **Parallel launch:** Content creation runs alongside strategy/build

### Why business_14

- Businesses 0-13 already exist
- business_14 is next available slot
- Clean slate for new opportunity
