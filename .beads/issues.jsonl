Add TodoWritePostTool hook to trigger on bead closures\n2. Add BashPostTool hook for git sync automation\n3. Follow pattern from Claude Code hooks documentation\n4. Test with bead closure to verify automation works\n\nThis bead should be worked next as it improves development process and prevents data loss before Build phase starts.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:41:03.382012-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-09T01:47:15.04309-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:49:19.144568-05:00"}
