## Email 2: Problem Agitation

**Send:** Day 2 after signup
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: "The 'Intermediate Desert' [Real Developer Struggle]"
- B: "Why you're stuck at junior level (and how to fix it)"
- C: "Either there are too few resources for intermediate developers, or they are too difficult to find"

**Preheader:** "The gap between beginner and advanced content is real. Here's how DevTutorials bridges it."

---

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Let's talk about a problem I see every day on Reddit and in developer communities.

**The "Intermediate Desert"**

You've been coding for 6 months to 2 years. You know the basics:

✅ You can build a simple React app
✅ You understand basic JavaScript
✅ You've done a few tutorials

**But you're stuck.**

Every time you try to learn something intermediate:
- Pluralsight wants $50/month for a subscription you'll barely use
- Udemy courses are outdated (React Router v4 in 2026?)
- YouTube tutorials are hit-or-miss quality
- FreeCodeCamp is great for beginners, but doesn't go deep enough

**Sound familiar?**

You're not alone. Here's what developers are saying:

> *"Either there are too few resources for intermediate developers, or they are too difficult to find"*
> — Reddit, r/webdev

> *"I am stuck in tutorial hell. Does anyone actually learn to code from YouTube tutorials?"*
> — Reddit, r/learnprogramming

> *"Frustrated with misleading tutorials and courses...expensive courses that teach only syntax without teaching how to build usable applications"*
> — Survey respondent

**The DevTutorials solution:**

We're curating **project-based tutorials that bridge the gap between beginner and advanced**.

**Real projects. Real skills. No subscriptions.**

Each tutorial:
- Takes 1 weekend to complete
- Results in a portfolio-worthy project
- Uses current, production-ready code
- Taught by developers with 5+ years experience
- Updated every 6 months or removed

**Example Tutorial: "Build a Full-Stack E-commerce API with Node.js & TypeScript"**
- Duration: 8 hours
- What you'll build: RESTful API with auth, testing, deployment
- Skills: Express, TypeScript, JWT, Docker, PostgreSQL
- Price: $19 one-time

**Launch is coming soon.** You'll get early access 24 hours before everyone else.

Got a specific skill gap you're trying to fill? Reply and let me know—I read every reply.

Best,
[Founder Name]

P.S. The first 100 waitlist members get 20% off at launch. Your spot is reserved.

## Email 3: Social Proof + Creator Teaser

**Send:** Day 5 after signup
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: "Who's creating our tutorials? [Meet the experts]"
- B: "Learn from developers at companies like [Company List]"
- C: "Quality guarantee: Why our tutorials are different"

**Preheader:** "Meet the expert developers creating DevTutorials content. 5+ years experience minimum."

---

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

One question I get a lot: **"Who's creating these tutorials?"**

Great question. Quality matters.

**Our Creator Vetting Process:**

Every DevTutorials creator must have:
✅ **5+ years** of professional development experience
✅ **Production experience** with the technologies they teach
✅ **Teaching experience** (bootcamp instructor, YouTube, Udemy, or technical writing)
✅ **Real-world projects** they've shipped to production

**Why this matters:**

I've wasted money on Udemy courses from "instructors" who:
- Learned the technology last week
- Never shipped code to production
- Teach syntax, not problem-solving
- Use outdated patterns and libraries

**Not here.**

**Meet some of our launch creators:**

**Sarah K.** (10 years experience)
- Former Senior Engineer at [Tech Company]
- Creating: "Advanced React Performance Optimization"
- You'll learn: Memoization, code splitting, lazy loading, bundle analysis

**Marcus L.** (7 years experience)
- Full-stack developer & bootcamp instructor
- Creating: "Build a Real-Time Chat App with Node.js & WebSockets"
- You'll learn: Socket.io, authentication, database design, scaling

**Priya M.** (6 years experience)
- Frontend lead at [Startup], previously at [Big Tech]
- Creating: "TypeScript for Production React Apps"
- You'll learn: Type safety, generics, utility types, error handling

**Quality guarantee:**

Every tutorial is:
- **Peer-reviewed** by another expert before publication
- **Code-tested** to ensure everything works
- **Updated every 6 months** or removed from the platform
- **Refundable** if you're not satisfied (no questions asked)

**Compare to Udemy:**
- Udemy: 250,000+ courses (many outdated, low quality)
- DevTutorials: 50-100 tutorials (all expert-vetted, fresh)

**We're about quality, not quantity.**

**Launching soon.** You're on the early access list (24 hours before public launch).

Want to see a sample tutorial chapter before launch? Reply "SAMPLE" and I'll send you a preview.

Best,
[Founder Name]

P.S. If you know great developers who should create tutorials, forward them this email. We pay 70% of every sale (4x better than Udemy).
