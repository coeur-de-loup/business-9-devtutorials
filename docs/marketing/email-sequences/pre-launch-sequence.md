Hey [Name],

Thanks for joining the DevTutorials waitlist! 🎉

**Quick intro:** We're building a marketplace for project-based developer tutorials, specifically for intermediate developers who've outgrown beginner content.

**The problem we're solving:**

You know that feeling when you're stuck between "too easy" and "way too advanced"? Yeah, we hate it too.

Intermediate developers (6 months to 2 years experience) are stuck in what we call the "intermediate desert" — either content is too basic, or it assumes 5+ years of experience.

**What makes DevTutorials different:**

✅ **Quality guarantee** - Expert-vetted tutorials, 6-month freshness requirement
✅ **Fair to creators** - 70% revenue share (vs. 15% on Udemy)
✅ **No subscription fatigue** - One-time purchases ($9-29), lifetime access
✅ **Actually intermediate** - No "hello world", just real projects

**What's next:**

Over the next week, I'll share:
- Why we're obsessed with the "intermediate gap" problem
- Which expert creators are already on board
- Early access details when we launch

**Want to help shape the platform?**

Reply to this email and tell me: What's the ONE skill you're struggling to learn right now?

I read every reply.

Founder, DevTutorials

P.S. We're keeping the waitlist small to ensure quality. Forward this to a developer friend who might appreciate it? 🙏

**Email Metrics:**
- **Goal:** 50% open rate, 10% reply rate
- **CTA:** Reply with current learning challenge
- **Timing:** Immediate upon signup
- **Segmentation:** None (all waitlist)

## Email 2: Value - The Intermediate Gap (Day 2)

**Subject Lines (A/B Test Options):**
1. "The 'intermediate desert' (and why you're stuck)"
2. "Why learning gets harder after 6 months"
3. "The gap nobody talks about"
4. "6 months in... now what?"
5. "Why you can't find good tutorials anymore"

**Preheader Text:**
"The intermediate gap is real. Here's the data (and how we're fixing it)"

**Body:**

---

Hey [Name],

Quick question: When was the last time you found a tutorial that felt *just right* — not too easy, not too advanced?

If you're like most intermediate developers, the answer is "rarely, if ever."

**Here's the problem:**

Based on 45+ Reddit discussions and developer community threads, there's a massive gap in learning resources:

**Beginner (0-6 months):**
- Tons of content (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, YouTube)
- Clear learning paths
- Easy to find help

**Intermediate (6 months - 2 years):**
- ⚠️ The "intermediate desert"
- Either too basic or assumes 5+ years experience
- No clear path forward

**Expert (2+ years):**
- Documentation, conferences, peer learning
- Deep expertise communities
- But you're stuck trying to get here

**The data backs this up:**

Quote from r/learnprogramming: *"Either there are too few resources for intermediate developers, or they are too difficult to find"*

Another developer: *"I feel like I've exhausted beginner resources but I'm not ready for advanced content. I'm stuck in tutorial hell."*

**How DevTutorials fixes this:**

We're *only* focused on intermediate developers:

✅ **Project-based learning** — Build real apps, not toy examples
✅ **Expert-vetted quality** — Creators must have 5+ years professional experience
✅ **Freshness guarantee** — Content updated within 6 months or removed
✅ **Intermediate-specific** — No beginner content, no PhD-level theory

**Real talk:**

You don't need another "hello world" tutorial. You need to build portfolio-worthy projects that get you hired.

That's what DevTutorials delivers.

**What intermediate skill are you trying to level up right now?**

Hit reply — I'm genuinely curious.

## Email 3: Social Proof - Creators (Day 5)

**Subject Lines (A/B Test Options):**
1. "Who's building DevTutorials? Meet the creators"
2. "Why 20+ expert devs are joining us"
3. "The talent behind DevTutorials"
4. "70% revenue share (vs. 15% on Udemy)"
5. "Expert creators, fair pay"

**Preheader Text:**
"Expert creators are choosing DevTutorials. Here's why (and who's already on board)"

**Body:**

---

Hey [Name],

Big update: The creator community is growing faster than expected.

**Why this matters for you:**

Better creators = better tutorials = better skills for you.

**The creator exodus from Udemy:**

Here's what's happening in the industry:

Udemy used to pay instructors 50% of sales. By 2026? That dropped to **15% on subscription purchases**.

Result: Expert instructors are leaving in droves.

Quote from a top Udemy instructor: *"I went from earning $5K/month to $800/month when they changed the revenue split. I can't justify creating new content anymore."*

**The DevTutorials difference:**

We pay creators **70%** of every sale.

Let me repeat that: **70%** to creators, 30% to platform.

That's **4.7x better** than Udemy's current rate.

**Who's already on board:**

We've got [X] expert creators signed up across:
- Full-stack development (React, Node, TypeScript)
- DevOps and deployment (Docker, AWS, CI/CD)
- Backend engineering (APIs, databases, authentication)
- Frontend architecture (state management, testing, performance)

**Creator requirements:**

- ✅ 5+ years professional experience
- ✅ Real-world project expertise
- ✅ Commitment to 6-month content updates
- ✅ Peer-reviewed before publication

**What this means for your learning:**

You're not learning from random YouTubers. You're learning from senior engineers who've built production systems at scale.

**Want first access when we launch?**

Keep an eye on your inbox — launch announcement coming in 2 days.

Hey [Name],

Yesterday we launched DevTutorials. The response has been incredible — **[X] tutorials sold in the first 24 hours!** 🚀

But I noticed you haven't grabbed your tutorials yet.

**No pressure — but I wanted to make you an offer:**

As a waitlist member, you get **30% off everything** for the next 48 hours.
