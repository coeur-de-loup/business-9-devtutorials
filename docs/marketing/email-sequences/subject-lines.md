## A/B Testing Best Practices

### Sample Size Calculator

**Minimum sample per variant:** 1,000 subscribers
- For statistical significance (95% confidence, ±5% margin)
- Smaller lists: Test anyway, but results may not be significant

### Test Duration

**Standard:** 7 days (captures full week patterns)
**Urgency emails:** 24-48 hours (time-sensitive)
**Launch emails:** 48 hours (maximize early opens)

### What to Test

**Priority 1 (Test First):**
1. Subject lines (biggest impact on open rate)
2. Send time (morning vs. evening)
3. Preheader text (often displayed in inbox)

**Priority 2 (Test Later):**
4. Email length (short vs. long)
5. CTA button text (color, wording)
6. Personalization (name vs. no name)
7. Sender name (founder vs. brand)

### What NOT to Test

❌ Testing multiple variables at once (ruins data)
❌ Testing without statistical significance (false confidence)
❌ Testing on small segments (<500 people)
❌ Testing for too short (<3 days) or too long (>14 days)

### Measurement Metrics

**Open Rate:** Primary metric for subject line tests
**Click Rate:** Secondary metric (content quality)
**Unsubscribe Rate:** Negative signal (too aggressive?)
**Conversion Rate:** Ultimate metric (drives revenue)

**Benchmark Rates:**
- **Learner emails:** 20-30% open rate, 2-4% click rate
- **Creator emails:** 40-50% open rate, 6-10% click rate
- **Launch emails:** 35-45% open rate, 5-8% click rate

## Winning Subject Line Patterns

### High-Performing Patterns (Based on Industry Data)

**1. Numbers & Lists**
- "5 reasons why..."
- "3 steps to..."
- "10 tools for..."

**2. Questions**
- "Ready to...?"
- "Why you're stuck at..."
- "What if you could...?"

**3. Urgency & Scarcity**
- "Last call:..."
- "24 hours left..."
- "Only X spots remaining..."

**4. Negative Bias (Fear of Missing Out)**
- "Why we reject 40%..."
- "Stop wasting time..."
- "The #1 mistake..."

**5. Curiosity Gaps**
- "The secret to..."
- "What nobody tells you about..."
- "Here's what's missing from..."

**6. Personalization**
- "Hi [Name], here's..."
- "You're on the list!"
- "Your early access link"

### Low-Performing Patterns (Avoid)

❌ "News / Update / Monthly" (too generic)
❌ "Free bonus inside" (spammy)
❌ All caps "URGENT" (spam filters)
❌ Excessive exclamation marks "!!!!" (unprofessional)
