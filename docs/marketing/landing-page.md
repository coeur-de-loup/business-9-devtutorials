## 3. Problem Section - "The Intermediate Gap"

### Section Headline

> "You're Not a Beginner Anymore. But You Don't Feel Intermediate Yet."

### Subheadline

> "Most platforms teach you syntax. We teach you to build real systems."

### Problem Pain Points (3-column layout)

**Column 1: The Content Gap**
> "Either there are too few resources for intermediate developers, or they are too difficult to find." — *Reddit, r/learnprogramming*

- Can't find resources beyond "hello world"
- Too advanced for Codecademy, can't afford Pluralsight
- Stuck at junior level, watching your peers advance

**Column 2: The Quality Problem**
> "Frustrated with misleading tutorials and courses...expensive courses that teach only syntax without teaching how to build usable applications." — *Developer Survey*

- Wasted money on outdated Udemy courses
- Tutorials with broken code (React 16, old syntax)
- No quality curation—hit or miss content

**Column 3: The Subscription Trap**
> "I'm already paying for Frontend Masters ($39/mo), Coursera ($49/mo), and Educative ($149/yr). I can't justify another subscription." — *Intermediate Developer*

- Subscription fatigue is real
- Paying $240-600/year across multiple platforms
- Want to own content, not rent it monthly

### Problem Section CTA

> [There's a Better Way ↓]

## 6. Creator Section - "For Tutorial Creators"

### Section Headline (Creator-Focused)

### Subheadline

> "Instructor revenue on Udemy dropped from 25% to 15% by 2026. We pay 4.7x more. Plus built-in audience."

### Creator Problem/Solution

> - You drive all the traffic, they keep most of the money

> - $19 sale: You keep $13.30
> - 100 sales: $1,330 in your pocket
> - No monthly platform fees (unlike Teachable's $69-249/mo)
> - Predictable per-sale revenue

**Column 2: Built-In Audience**
> "We bring the learners. You create the content."
>
> - 5,000+ developers and growing
> - Targeted audience: intermediate devs actively seeking learning
> - Featured placement opportunities

## 10. FAQ

### Section Headline

> "Frequently Asked Questions"

### FAQ Accordion (10-12 Questions)

**For Learners:**

**Q1: "How is this different from Udemy?"**
> A: Quality curation and fairness. Udemy has 250,000 courses with no quality control (most are low-quality or outdated). We have 150-500 expert-vetted tutorials, all updated within 6 months or removed. Plus, our 70% creator revenue attracts better instructors.

**Q2: "Why pay when YouTube is free?"**
> A: Time savings and quality. You get what you pay for. YouTube is hit-or-miss. Our tutorials are expert-vetted, updated weekly, and include working code. Save 10+ hours searching for one good tutorial. Most developers recoup their investment in one weekend.

**Q3: "I already have a Frontend Masters subscription. Why buy this?"**
> A: Two reasons: (1) Project-based vs. lecture-based. Frontend Masters is great for theory, but we teach by building real apps. (2) No subscription fatigue. Buy what you need, when you need it. Stop paying $39/month for content you don't use.

**Q4: "$19-29 seems expensive for a tutorial."**
> A: Compare to alternatives. A Udemy course at the same quality level would cost $50-100 (if you can find one). Plus, our tutorials include:
> - Working code (not broken examples)
> - Source code included
> - Creator Q&A (48hr response)
> - Free lifetime updates
> - 6-month freshness guarantee
>
> Most developers tell us it pays for itself within one week on the job.

**Q5: "What if I don't like the tutorial?"**
> A: 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. Plus, our 6-month freshness guarantee means if content becomes outdated, you get free updates or a refund. We're confident you'll love it.

**Q6: "How long do I have access?"**
> A: Forever. One-time purchase = lifetime access. Plus, when we update the tutorial, you get the new version free. No subscriptions, no expiring access.

**Q7: "I'm a complete beginner. Is this for me?"**
> A: Probably not yet. Our tutorials are designed for intermediate developers (6 months to 2 years experience). We recommend starting with freeCodeCamp or Codecademy, then coming here when you're ready to bridge to mid-level.

**Q8: "Do you offer certificates?"**
> A: Yes. Each completed tutorial includes a verified certificate you can share on LinkedIn. But more importantly, you'll have a production-quality project for your portfolio—which employers value 10x more than certificates.

**Q9: "Can I get a refund if the content becomes outdated?"**
> A: Yes, that's our freshness guarantee. If a tutorial isn't updated within 6 months, we either remove it or issue you a full refund. Plus, you get free updates whenever we refresh content.

**For Creators:**

**Q10: "How do I become a creator?"**
> A: Apply here. Takes 5 minutes. We vet for:
> - 5+ years professional experience
> - Quality of past content
> - Teaching ability
>
> Approval in 48 hours. Start earning 70% immediately.

**Q11: "Do I have to move all my content from Udemy?"**
> A: No. Start with 1-2 tutorials to test the platform. If you earn more (you will), migrate more over time. Many creators keep Udemy for volume sales and use DevTutorials for premium content.

**Q12: "Is 70% sustainable? How does DevTutorials make money?"**
> A: Absolutely. We keep 30% to cover:
> - Video hosting and delivery
> - Payment processing
> - Marketing and audience building
> - Platform maintenance
> - Quality curation and support
>
> Our 30% margin is standard for marketplaces (Amazon: 25-30%, Etsy: 36-40%). We're lean, efficient, and creator-first.
