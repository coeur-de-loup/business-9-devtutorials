### Tweet 1: The Intermediate Desert Thread
```
🧵 Why intermediate developers are stuck (and what to do about it)

After analyzing 45+ Reddit discussions, I found the #1 problem:

"The intermediate desert"

You've outgrown Codecademy but can't access Frontend Masters. You're stuck in tutorial hell, building toy apps but can't work independently.

The gap is real. Here's what helps:

1/ Project-based learning (not just following along)
2/ Code reviews from experienced devs
3/ Building production-quality apps (not todo lists)

I'm building something to help solve this. More soon.

#webdev #javascript #learnprogramming
```

### Tweet 2: Tutorial Quality Problem
```
Why 95% of tutorials fail intermediate developers:

❌ Outdated syntax (React 16 patterns in 2026)
❌ No error handling (happy path only)
❌ Toy apps (todo, weather, calculator)
❌ No architecture explanation (just "copy this")

What works:
✅ Production-quality code
✅ Real-world scenarios
✅ Error handling & edge cases
✅ Architecture decisions

Your time is worth more than free tutorials.

#coding #webdev #reactjs
```

### Tweet 3: Creator Revenue Share
```
Udemy instructors are getting crushed:

2022: 25% revenue share
2023: 20%
2024: 17.5%
2026: 15%

Meanwhile, they're working harder than ever:
• 20+ hours per course
• Constant updates required
• Handling all support
• Driving their own traffic

This isn't sustainable.

I believe creators deserve better.

70% revenue share. Built-in audience. Quality curation.

Coming soon.

#edtech #creatoreconomy #onlinelearning
```

### Tweet 4: Tutorial Hell
```
"I'm stuck in tutorial hell" - Every intermediate developer, ever

You follow tutorials step-by-step. You build the app. You feel like you learned something.

Then you try to build something on your own.

Blank screen. No idea where to start.

The problem:
Tutorials teach syntax, not problem-solving.

The solution:
Projects that force you to make architectural decisions.

Not "copy this code" but "why this approach?"

Building something to help fix this.

#webdev #coding #programming
```

### Tweet 5: Subscription Fatigue
```
The math on subscription fatigue:

Frontend Masters: $39/mo = $468/year
Egghead: $35/mo = $420/year
Pluralsight: $29/mo = $348/year
LinkedIn Learning: $30/mo = $360/year

Total: $1,596/year 🤯

And you're lucky if you use 2-3 courses per platform.

Alternative:
Buy what you need, when you need it.
One tutorial = $19
Lifetime access.
Up-to-date content.

Stop renting your education. Own it.

#webdev #javascript #react
```

### Tweet 6: State Management
```
The most confusing part of React:

State management.

Context? Redux? Zustand? Recoil? Jotai?

Every tutorial uses a different one. Twitter debates which is "best." Job postings want Redux experience.

Here's the truth:

Most intermediate apps DON'T need complex state management.

• Local state (useState) = component-specific
• Context + useReducer = shared state, medium complexity
• Zustand/Jotai = global state, need simplicity
• Redux = enterprise scale, team collaboration

The problem: Tutorials teach HOW, not WHEN.

Building something to fix this.

#reactjs #webdev #javascript
```

### Tweet 7: Outdated Content
```
I followed a React tutorial last week.

Used Class Components.
Old lifecycle methods.
Deprecated Redux patterns.

The tutorial was from 2021.
It's now 2026.

That's 5 years out of date. ❌

This is why intermediate developers are stuck.

They follow "free" tutorials that:
• Use deprecated syntax
• Teach bad patterns
• Don't work in modern codebases

Time wasted: 10+ hours
Result: More confused than when you started

Quality costs $19.
Outdated free content costs you hours of frustration.

#webdev #react #javascript
```

### Tweet 8: The Gap
```
The intermediate developer salary gap:

Junior dev: $55,000/year
Mid-level dev: $90,000/year
Difference: $35,000/year

To bridge this gap, you need:
• Testing skills (Jest, Cypress, TDD)
• System design (architecture, scalability)
• DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, deployment)
• Advanced patterns (state management, performance)

Where do you learn these?

Beginner platforms don't teach them.
Advanced platforms assume you already know them.

The gap is real.

Building something to help bridge it.

#webdev #coding #career
```

### Tweet 9: Production-Quality Code
```
What "production-quality" means for intermediate developers:

Your todo app tutorial?
✅ Works on your machine
✅ No error handling
✅ No tests
✅ Not deployed

Production-quality app?
✅ Error handling (what if API fails?)
✅ Loading states (what if user has slow internet?)
✅ Input validation (what if user enters bad data?)
✅ Tests (unit + integration)
✅ Deployed (live URL for portfolio)
✅ Documentation (README with setup instructions)

The gap: Tutorials teach the first, jobs require the second.

Building project-based tutorials that teach production-quality skills.

#webdev #react #bestpractices
```

### Tweet 10: Community Support
```
The biggest mistake intermediate developers make:

Learning in isolation.

You watch tutorials alone. You code alone. You get stuck alone.

Meanwhile, senior developers have:
• Code reviews from peers
• Mentors to ask questions
• Team discussions on architecture
• Pair programming sessions

How do you replicate this as an intermediate dev?

1. Join developer communities (Discord, Reddit, Slack)
2. Share your code and ask for feedback
3. Review others' code (learn from their mistakes)
4. Build in public (Twitter, GitHub)

You don't need a job to get job-like learning experiences.

Community = Accelerated learning.

## Build-in-Public Updates

### Tweet 11: Week 1 Update
```
Week 1 of building DevTutorials:

✅ Validated the problem (85% confidence from 45+ research sources)
✅ Defined the business model (70% creator share)
✅ Created customer avatars (hello, Intermediate Ilya!)
✅ Started recruiting creators (5 interested so far)

This week:
• Finalizing landing page
• Reaching out to 50 Udemy instructors
• Building waitlist (goal: 2,000 emails)

Building in public. Updates weekly.

#buildinpublic #indiehacking #startup
```

### Tweet 12: Freshness Guarantee
```
Why I'm obsessed with the 6-month freshness guarantee:

I followed a React tutorial last week.
Used Class Components.
Old lifecycle methods.
Deprecated Redux patterns.

The tutorial was from 2021.
It's now 2026.

That's 5 years out of date. ❌

My rule:
Update your content within 6 months or we remove it.

Quality > Quantity.

#webdev #react #edtech
```

### Tweet 13: Creator Recruitment
```
Calling all Udemy instructors frustrated with revenue cuts:

I'm building DevTutorials - a curated marketplace for intermediate developers.

Key differences from Udemy:
🎯 70% creator revenue share (vs. your 15%)
🎯 Quality curation (not 250K courses to compete with)
🎯 Intermediate-only focus (less competition, better fit)
🎯 6-month freshness guarantee (content stays relevant)

First 50 creators get:
• Featured placement for 6 months
• 75% revenue share (lifetime)
• Marketing support from day 1

Interested? DM me or reply "interested"

#udemy #creatoreconomy #edtech
```

### Tweet 14: Behind the Scenes
```
Founder reality check:

Today I:
• Cold-emailed 50 Udemy instructors (3 responded)
• Wrote 2,000 words of landing page copy
• Analyzed 10 Reddit threads for insights
• Got rejected by a creator I really wanted
• Questioned if this will work 5 times
• Kept going because the problem is real

Building a startup isn't glamorous.
It's 100 small actions every day.

But the intermediate gap is real.
Developers are stuck.
Creators are underpaid.
Something needs to change.

So I'll keep going.

#buildinpublic #startuplife #indiehacking
```

### Tweet 15: Technical Decision
```
Tech stack decision for DevTutorials:

Next.js vs. Remix vs. Vite + React

I chose Next.js 14 (App Router).

Why?

1. Server components = faster page loads
2. Built-in routing = less boilerplate
3. API routes = full-stack in one repo
4. Vercel deployment = zero config
5. Large community = easy to find answers

Tradeoffs:
• Learning curve (App Router is new)
• Flexibility (opinionated framework)
• Vendor lock-in (optimized for Vercel)

For a solo founder shipping fast?
Next.js is the right choice.

#webdev #nextjs #react
```

### Tweet 16: Validation
``
Just got off a call with a Udemy instructor:

"I used to make $4K/month on Udemy. Now I make $2K. They cut my revenue share from 25% to 15%. I'm working the same hours, making better courses, but earning less."

The problem isn't the quality of his content (4.8/5 rating, 50K students).
The problem is the platform model.

Udemy is a volume game (250K courses).
Creators are commodities.

I'm building a quality-first platform.
100-500 curated courses vs. 250,000.
70% to creators vs. 15%.

Quality scales.

#buildinpublic #edtech #creatoreconomy
```

### Tweet 17: Milestone
```
Small win today:

10th creator signed up for DevTutorials!

Who:
• Former senior dev at Google
• 12 years experience
• Made 20 courses on Udemy
• Frustrated with 15% revenue cut

Why he joined:
"Warehouse vs. boutique. Udemy is Walmart. DevTutorials is a curated shop. I want to be in the curated shop."

The vision is working.
Quality attracts quality.

#buildinpublic #startup #edtech
```

### Tweet 18: Research Insight
``
Spent the weekend analyzing 50+ Reddit threads about the "intermediate gap."

Key finding:

The #1 question intermediate devs ask:

"What should I learn next?"

Not "how do I learn X" but "what is X?"

The intermediate desert isn't just about resources.
It's about ROADMAPS.

Beginners: "Learn HTML → CSS → JavaScript" (clear path)
Intermediates: "Learn... testing? Or deployment? Or system design?" (paralysis)

Solution:
DevTutorials will organize tutorials into learning paths.
"React Developer Path" = 7 curated tutorials in order.

Roadmaps reduce paralysis.

#webdev #coding #learnprogramming
```

### Tweet 19: Challenge
```
The hardest part of building a two-sided marketplace:

The chicken-and-egg problem.

Creators won't join without learners.
Learners won't join without creators.

How to solve it?

Creator-first approach:

1. Guarantee creators $500/tutorial (advance on sales)
2. Offer 75% revenue share (vs. standard 70%)
3. Featured placement for first 50 creators
4. Personal outreach (I DM every creator)

Cost: $25,000 for 50 tutorials
Risk: High
Alternative: Don't build it.

The intermediate gap is real.
Someone needs to solve it.

Might as well be me.

#buildinpublic #marketplace #startup
```

### Tweet 20: Learning
```
Mistake I made this week:

I spent 3 days building a complex feature for creators.
(Animated revenue dashboard with real-time updates)

Showed it to a creator.
They said: "I just want to know how much I made this month. Keep it simple."

I built for myself (show off technical skills), not the user (solve their problem).

The lesson:
Simple solutions beat complex features every time.

Shipping the simple version tomorrow.

## Engagement/Question Tweets

### Tweet 21: Poll - Skill Gap
```
Intermediate developers: What's the hardest skill gap you're facing right now?

A) State management (Redux, Zustand, Context)
B) Testing (Jest, Cypress, TDD)
C) Backend (APIs, databases, auth)
D) Deployment (Docker, CI/CD, cloud)
E) System design (architecture, scalability)

Reply with your choice and I'll prioritize content for it.

#webdev #javascript #reactjs
```

### Tweet 22: Discussion Starter
```
Unpopular opinion:

The "tutorial hell" problem isn't about tutorials.

It's about how you use them.

If you copy-paste code without understanding: tutorial hell.
If you pause to ask "why did they do it this way?": learning.

The difference:
• Passive vs. active learning
• Following vs. understanding
• Syntax vs. problem-solving

What do you think?

#coding #programming #webdev
```

### Tweet 23: Open Question
``
Question for intermediate developers (6mo-2yr experience):

What's ONE tutorial you wish existed that doesn't?

Example: "How to build a full-stack app with React, Node, and PostgreSQL from scratch"

Drop your dream tutorial topic 👇

I'll make sure the top requested ones get created.

#webdev #coding #learnprogramming
```

### Tweet 24: Advice Request
``
I need advice from intermediate developers:

When you're evaluating a paid tutorial ($19-29), what matters most?

A) Instructor credentials (years of experience)
B) Project quality (what you'll build)
C) Content length (3-5 hours vs. 6-10 hours)
D) Reviews/ratings from other learners
E) Free preview (first lesson free)

Reply with your top 2 priorities.

#webdev #edtech #onlinelearning
```

### Tweet 25: Resource Sharing
``
I'll start:

Best free resource I found for intermediate React development:

Kent C. Dodds' blog (epicreact.dev)

Why:
• Teaches patterns, not just syntax
• Explains "why" not just "how"
• Production-quality examples
• Up-to-date (React 18+)

Your turn: What's the best free intermediate dev resource you've found?

Drop it below 👇

#webdev #react #javascript
```

### Tweet 26: Experience Question
```
Question for those who made the jump from junior to mid-level:

What was the SKILL that made the difference?

Not the project, not the certification - the specific skill.

• Testing?
• System design?
• Code review ability?
• Communication?
• Something else?

Reply with the skill that got you promoted.

#webdev #career #coding
```

### Tweet 27: Hot Take
```
Hot take:

Most intermediate developers don't need more tutorials.

They need:
1. Code reviews (feedback on their code)
2. Real projects (not toy apps)
3. Deadlines (ship it, even if it's imperfect)
4. Peer learning (explain concepts to others)

Tutorials are safe (follow instructions).
Building is scary (make decisions).

But building is where learning happens.

Agree or disagree?

#webdev #coding #programming
```

### Tweet 28: Hypothetical
``
Hypothetical scenario:

You're a junior developer (1 year experience).
You want to become a mid-level developer ($55K → $90K salary).

You have $100 to spend on learning.

Do you:
A) Buy 5 Udemy courses ($20 each) - self-paced, hit-or-miss quality
B) Buy 1 DevTutorial ($19) + 1 coffee, save the rest - expert-vetted, project-based
C) Subscribe to Frontend Masters for 3 months ($39/mo) - high quality, but subscription
D) Save the money, stick with free resources (YouTube, docs)

Reply with A, B, C, or D and why.

#webdev #career #learning
```

### Tweet 29: Failure Story
``
I'll share a failure:

When I was an intermediate developer, I bought a $50 Udemy course on "Advanced React Patterns."

The instructor:
• Had 2 years experience (not "advanced")
• Used deprecated patterns (Redux with thunks, not Redux Toolkit)
• Copied code from documentation
• Had 4.8/5 rating (fake reviews?)

Result: Wasted $50, wasted 10 hours, learned outdated patterns.

Ever been burned by a paid course? What happened?

#webdev #edtech #coding
```

### Tweet 30: Celebration
``
Let's celebrate some wins:

Drop a comment below sharing:
• A skill you learned recently
• A project you shipped
• A concept that finally clicked

I'll start:
I finally understand when to use Redux vs. Context. (Answer: Most apps don't need either. Zustand is simpler.)

Your turn! 👏

## Image/Video Post Ideas

### Image 1: Visual Comparison
```
Create a side-by-side graphic:

LEFT: "Typical Tutorial"
❌ Todo app
❌ No error handling
❌ No tests
❌ Outdated (2021 code)
❌ "Copy this"

RIGHT: "DevTutorial"
✅ Real-world app (e.g., SaaS dashboard)
✅ Error handling throughout
✅ Unit + integration tests
✅ Fresh (updated <6 months ago)
✅ "Here's why we're doing this"

Caption: "Stop following tutorials. Start building like a pro."
```

### Image 2: Revenue Comparison
```
Create a bar chart:

Udemy (15%): $3 per $20 sale (creator keeps $3)
DevTutorials (70%): $14 per $20 sale (creator keeps $14)

Caption: "Which platform would you rather sell on?"

Follow-up text: "That's 4.7x better creator revenue. No wonder Udemy instructors are leaving."
```

### Image 3: The Intermediate Gap
```
Create a timeline visualization:

Beginner (0-6 months):
Resources: Abundant (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, YouTube)
Confidence: High (clear path forward)

⬇️

INTERMEDIATE (6mo-2 years): THE DESERT
Resources: Scarce
Confidence: Low (what do I learn next?)

⬇️

Advanced (2+ years):
Resources: Plentiful (Frontend Masters, Pluralsight, conferences)
Confidence: High (specialized expertise)

Caption: "The intermediate desert is real. I'm building an oasis."
```

### Image 4: Subscription Math
```
Create a simple infographic:

Subscription Hell:
Frontend Masters: $468/year
Egghead: $420/year
Pluralsight: $348/year
LinkedIn Learning: $360/year
TOTAL: $1,596/year

And you watch 2-3 courses per year.
Cost per course: $532 😱

DevTutorials:
Buy what you need, when you need it.
$19 per tutorial (lifetime access)

Same 3 courses: $57
YOU SAVE: $1,539/year

Caption: "Stop renting your education. Own it."
```

### Thread 1: The 5 Signs You're Stuck at Intermediate
```
1/10
5 signs you're stuck in the "intermediate desert" (and what to do about it)

🧵
#webdev #coding #career

2/10
Sign #1: You can follow tutorials but can't build from scratch

You watch a 4-hour tutorial, build the app, feel like you learned it.

Then you try to build something on your own.

Blank screen. No idea where to start.

The problem:
Tutorials teach syntax, not problem-solving.

#webdev #javascript

3/10
Sign #2: Junior jobs feel too easy, senior jobs feel out of reach

Job descriptions say "3-5 years experience required."
You have 1 year.

You know React, but you don't know:
- System design
- Testing strategies
- Deployment pipelines
- Architecture patterns

The gap is real.

#career #webdev

4/10
Sign #3: You're suffering from subscription fatigue

You're paying:
- Frontend Masters: $39/mo
- Pluralsight: $29/mo
- LinkedIn Learning: $30/mo

Total: $1,596/year

And you've watched 2 courses this year.

The math doesn't work.

#edtech #learning

5/10
Sign #4: You've fallen for "tutorial hell"

You follow tutorial after tutorial.
Your GitHub has 20+ tutorial projects.

But you still can't:
- Architect an app from scratch
- Make decisions (Redux vs. Context?)
- Debug errors on your own

Following ≠ Learning

#coding #programming

6/10
Sign #5: You feel like an imposter

Everyone else seems to "get it."
You're still struggling with concepts others mastered years ago.

You worry:
- "Am I not smart enough?"
- "Will I always be a junior?"
- "Should I just give up?"

Reality: The resources are failing you, not the other way around.

#mentalhealth #coding

7/10
So what do you do about it?

Solution #1: Build without tutorials

Start with a simple idea (weather app, blog, portfolio).
Get stuck.
THEN find tutorials for specific problems.

Learn by solving, not following.

#webdev #coding

8/10
Solution #2: Focus on production quality

Don't settle for "it works."

Add:
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Input validation
- Tests
- Deployment

These are the skills that get you promoted.

#bestpractices #webdev

9/10
Solution #3: Find curated, intermediate-focused resources

Not beginner platforms (you've outgrown them).
Not advanced subscriptions (you're not ready yet).

Intermediate-focused:
- Project-based learning
- Architecture explanations
- Production-quality code
- Up-to-date content

#edtech #learning

10/10
The intermediate gap is real.

You're not alone.
You're not "stupid."
The resources just aren't there yet.

I'm building DevTutorials to fix this.

Curated marketplace for intermediate developers.
Project-based tutorials.
Expert-vetted creators.
6-month freshness guarantee.

Launching soon with 50 tutorials.

### Thread 2: Why Udemy Instructors Are Leaving
```
1/8
Why Udemy instructors are leaving in droves (and where they're going)

A thread 🧵

#edtech #creatoreconomy #udemy

2/8
Udemy's revenue cuts over time:

2020: 25% to instructors (75% to Udemy)
2022: 20% to instructors
2024: 17.5% to instructors
2026: 15% to instructors

Meanwhile, instructors are working harder than ever.

#udemy #creators

3/8
Here's what instructors do for their 15%:

• Create 20+ hours of video content
• Update courses constantly (or they become outdated)
• Handle all student support (thousands of questions)
• Drive their own traffic (Udemy doesn't promote them)
• Deal with fake reviews and competition

It's exhausting.

#creatoreconomy

4/8
The math on a $20 course:

Udemy keeps: $17 (85%)
Instructor keeps: $3 (15%)

To make $3K/month:
Instructor needs 1,000 sales/month.

That's 12,000 sales/year.
Good luck with that.

#math #creators

5/8
Compare that to DevTutorials:

DevTutorials keeps: $6 (30%)
Creator keeps: $14 (70%)

To make $3K/month:
Creator needs 215 sales/month.

That's 2,580 sales/year.

4.7x fewer sales needed for same income.

#edtech #fairpay

6/8
But wait, doesn't Udemy have more traffic?

Yes: 250K courses = discoverability problems
No: You're buried in low-quality competition

DevTutorials:
• 100-500 curated courses (boutique vs. warehouse)
• Quality curation (you stand out for being good)
• Intermediate-only (less competition, better fit)

#marketplace

7/8
First 50 creators on DevTutorials get:

• 75% revenue share (lifetime, not just 70%)
• Featured placement for 6 months
• Marketing support from day 1
• Direct relationship with learners (not walled garden)

Interested? DM me.

#creators #opportunity

8/8
The creator economy is broken when platforms take 85%.

70% to creators is sustainable.
30% covers hosting, payments, curation, marketing.

I believe creators deserve better.

Udemy instructors: I'm building what you wish Udemy was.
